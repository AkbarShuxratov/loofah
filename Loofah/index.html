        <h2>1. 100% Naturalüåø</h2>
        <p>Loofahs are plant-based, not plastic!</p>
        <button class="like-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">Show more</button>
        <div class="details">
          <p>Loofahs are derived from the *Luffa aegyptiaca* plant, a cucumber-like gourd grown in tropical and subtropical regions. Once harvested and dried, their fibrous structure becomes an ideal natural scrubber, free from synthetic chemicals or additives found in plastic sponges. Choosing loofahs supports sustainable farming practices and reduces reliance on petroleum-based products.</p>

      <div class="reason">
        <h2>2. Biodegradableüß¨</h2>
        <p>They break down naturally, unlike sponges.</p>
        <button class="like-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">Show more</button>
        <div class="details">
          <p>Loofahs are fully biodegradable and can be composted in your backyard or green bin after 2‚Äì3 months of use. Unlike synthetic sponges, which can take hundreds of years to decompose in landfills, loofahs return to the earth without leaving harmful residues. This makes them a perfect choice for zero-waste households aiming to minimize environmental impact.</p>

      <div class="reason">
        <h2>3. Eco-Friendly‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>No microplastics in the water supply.</p>
        <button class="like-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">Show more</button>
        <div class="details">
          <p>Synthetic sponges shed microplastics during use, which enter waterways and harm marine life. Loofahs, being 100% natural, produce no microplastics, ensuring cleaner oceans and safer ecosystems. By switching to loofahs, you contribute to reducing the estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic entering the oceans annually.</p>

        <button class="like-btn" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">Show more</button>
        <div class="details">
          <p>The coarse, fibrous texture of loofahs provides superior exfoliation compared to smooth synthetic sponges, effectively removing dead skin cells and promoting blood circulation. Regular use can leave your skin feeling softer and more radiant. For best results, pair with a gentle body wash and use 2‚Äì3 times per week to avoid over-exfoliation.</p>

        <div class="details">
          <p>Unlike synthetic sponges, which can develop a chemical or musty odor due to trapped moisture and manufacturing residues, loofahs maintain a neutral, earthy scent. Their natural fibers don‚Äôt harbor artificial fragrances, making them ideal for sensitive skin or those with allergies. Rinse and dry thoroughly after use to keep them fresh.</p>

        <div class="details">
          <p>With proper care, loofahs can last up to 6 months, outlasting many synthetic sponges that degrade within weeks. Hang them in a well-ventilated area after use to prevent mold and extend their lifespan. This reusability reduces waste and makes loofahs a practical choice for eco-conscious consumers.</p>

        <div class="details">
          <p>While loofahs may have a slightly higher upfront cost, their durability means you replace them less frequently than synthetic sponges, saving money in the long run. A single loofah can replace multiple sponges, and some brands offer bulk packs for added savings. Plus, their compostable nature eliminates disposal costs.</p>
